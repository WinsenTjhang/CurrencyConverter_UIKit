#Mobile Application Assessment

As part of your application we invite you to complete the following coding assessment.

##Overview

The task we would like you to complete is to create an app that makes a call for international currency data (JSON) and use it to create a currency converter app that converts international currencies into Australian Dollars.  Refer to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines as a resource to provide a good customer experience.

##Github Usage

Please be sure to create a repository into your own project to complete the assessment.
Once the assessment is complete it should be shared back to madteam-devsupport with Developer access.
It is important you retain ownership and access control of your assessment.

##Requirements:

* The app must be written in Swift and Xcode
* Use of suitable design patterns, and a strict separation of concerns when developing a mobile application
* Use all the data the API provided
  * Asynchronous development principals when retrieving and displaying data originating from network calls
* UI interaction and data binding principals
* The application should be able to be re-branded (colours, fonts, assets) - 2 distinct branded targets/variants should be included in the project
* Correct use of the application life cycle, management of the UI thread
* Incremental Commits of code and proper use/understanding of gitflow
  * Quick Overview - <http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>
  * In-depth Tutorial - <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow>
* Unit tests/mocks to demonstrate the code is testable

##Getting Started
* The URL to get the fx data is ``https://www.westpac.com.au/bin/getJsonRates.wbc.fx.json``.
* For other platforms the use of frameworks, libraries, and open-source code is allowed â€“ but please reference their use in comments in the code. Please use package management for open source dependencies where suitable.
